# Simple Table

Code:

```ruby
require 'rtables'
table = RTables::Table::SimpleTable.new

table.add_column('Example')
table.add_column('Field')
table.add_row('First', 'This is an example text')
table.add_row('Small', 'Field')
table.add_row('Very Large Field', 'With a large amount of text on it.')

table.render
```
